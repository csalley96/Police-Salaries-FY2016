# Police-Salaries-FY2016
This database captures gross salary from July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 and includes only those employees who were employed on June 30, 2016.

The repository contains an excel file with the original downloaded data and analyses of simple regression, multiple regression, and correlation. Not all values had a Gross Pay, so for the analysis the Annual Salary column and Gross Pay column have the same value. 

# Description of Findings: 
The data showed a somewhat weak correlation between employment time and annual salary, having a value of about 0.5. The strongest correlation was actually between employment time and predicted annual salary, with a correlation of 1.0 - showing a perfect positive correlation. However, given the salary errors also calculated, this may not be the best independent variable to use with the dependent variable of time.

As you can see, the R^2 value for employment time and annual salary is relatively low at 0.2379. This tells us that the regression model accounts for about 24.0% of the variance. As we know, the more variance that is accounted for by the regression model the closer the data points will fall on the line. The variance is showing how spread out the values are from the mean. 
All independent variables for the multiple regression analysis of annual salary, predicted annual salary, and gross pay had low p-values, meaning we can reject the null hypothesis that that there is no significant difference between these specified populations and our dependent variable of employed time.
# Outline: 
Industry Question - Is there a strong relationship between time employed in the local government in the police department and annual salary?
Data Question - What data is available and what tools can be used to answer this industry question?
Data Answer - There is data found within the Baltimore City government open salary database, that has data on police salaries for this agency in the fiscal year of 2016. Regression and correlation can be done to see the relationship we want to find. 
Industry Answer - The data is able to show us multiple relationships between time of employment and salaries or gross pay. The data is able to show positive linear relationships and correlatioin between these variables.
