# Police-Salaries-FY2016
This database captures gross salary from July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 and includes only those employees who were employed on June 30, 2016.

The repository contains an excel file with the original downloaded data and analyses of simple regression, multiple regression, and correlation. Not all values had a Gross Pay, so for the analysis the Annual Salary column and Gross Pay column have the same value. 

# Description of Findings: 
The data showed a somewhat weak correlation between employment time and annual salary, having a value of about 0.5. The strongest correlation was actually between employment time and predicted annual salary, with a correlation of 1.0 showing a perfect positive correlation. However, given the salary errors also calculated, this may not be the best independent variable to use with the dependent variable of time.
